# Sysadmin Journey

This repository documents my transition from IT Support to Sysadmin / Server Engineering.

I currently work at a hosting company, where I deal with hosting environments, DNS, and WordPress-related issues.
Here I document my learning, notes, and small hands-on practices focused on Linux, networking, and servers.

This is an ongoing learning process.
